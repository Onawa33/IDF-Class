/*
How it works:
In line 6, we have declared a pointer to float p and a float variable s, where it is initialized to 0.
In line 7, we have declared two variables i and n of type int.
In line 9, printf() function prints "Enter the number of students: " to the console.
In line 10, scanf() is used to read input from the user, which is then stored in a variable n.
Line 12 uses malloc() function to dynamically allocate memory to store n numbers of type float. The variable p is of type pointer to float or (float*), thatâ€™s why the result of malloc() function is typecasted using (float*).
In line 15, the if condition checks whether the pointer returned by malloc() is null pointer or not. If p is NULL then memory allocation failed and the program terminates.
In line 21, we have a for loop which repeatedly asks the user to enter marks n times. Notice that in scanf() statement p + i is used without & sign because p is a pointer.
In line 29, we have another for loop which accumulates the marks of n students in a variable sum.
In line 34, Average marks are displayed by dividing total marks by a total number of students.
