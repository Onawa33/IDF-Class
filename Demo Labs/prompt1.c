Searching for Substrings
Program inputs a line of text and a search string from the keyboard. Using function strstr, locate the first occurence of the search
string in the line of text, and assign the location to variable searchPtr of type char *. If the search string is found, print the 
remainder of the line of text beginning with the search string. Then use strstr again to locate the next occurence of the search 
string in the line fo text. If a second occurence is found, print the remainder of the line of text beginning with the second occurence.
(HINT: The second call to strstr should contain searchPtr + 1 as its first argument.)
